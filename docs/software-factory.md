# ChurchCore Software Factory

**Status:** Active workflow guide  
**Date:** 2026-05-25  
**Applies to:** Claude Code and Codex sessions in this repository

## Purpose

The software factory is a small set of repository files that turns AI-assisted development into a repeatable workflow. It keeps ChurchCore work aligned with `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, ADRs, tenant boundaries, role access, sensitive-data rules, tests, and release discipline.

The software factory has three compatible surfaces:

- **Claude Code:** `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/`, and `.claude/settings.example.json`
- **Codex:** `.codex/skills/` plus the shared rules in `AGENTS.md`
- **Gemini (Antigravity):** `.gemini/skills/` plus the shared rules in `AGENTS.md` and native Planning Mode integration

Both surfaces follow the same chain:

```text
research -> story -> spec -> backend/frontend build -> tests -> validation -> PR review
```

## Transparency Standard

ChurchCore is built in the open from the repository's point of view. The factory must make each meaningful change traceable:

- **Intent:** the story, acceptance criteria, or brief states what problem is being solved.
- **Architecture:** the brief names the routes, data surfaces, tenant boundaries, RBAC rules, provider integrations, and ADRs involved.
- **Implementation:** the final summary names the files changed and the existing patterns reused.
- **Verification:** the handoff records the commands run, pass/fail status, and any pre-existing failures.
- **Documentation:** `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and relevant docs under `docs/` are updated when behavior, workflow, architecture, setup, or product positioning changes.
- **Residual risk:** unresolved gaps, waived findings, and follow-up work are stated explicitly instead of hidden in chat history.

If a future maintainer cannot understand the change without reading an AI chat transcript, the factory run is incomplete.

Factory runs are tracked in [docs/factory-runs](factory-runs/). Add or update a run record for every meaningful factory execution.

## Claude Code How-To

### Preferred Claude Workflow

Use Claude Code for the most automated factory path because it can use repo-local agents, skills, and hooks together.

```text
Use the feature-factory skill for <feature>.
Start with research, pause after the story, pause after the technical brief, update docs, run verification, then prepare the commit.
```

Preferred sequence:

1. Read `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, relevant docs, and relevant ADRs.
2. Invoke `feature-factory` for non-trivial features.
3. Approve or revise the story.
4. Approve or revise the technical brief.
5. Let the backend and frontend builder agents work sequentially.
6. Let the test verifier and implementation validator review the result.
7. Update `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and affected docs.
8. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and focused tests where applicable.
9. Use `pr-reviewer` or review the final diff before commit.
10. Commit on a feature branch, push the branch, open a pull request, merge through GitHub after required checks/review, then pull `main`.

### 1. Start With Repository Rules

Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md`, which points to `AGENTS.md`. Before meaningful work, the session should read:

1. `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
2. relevant docs in `docs/`
3. relevant ADRs in `docs/adr/`
4. `.claude/skills/build-with-tests/SKILL.md` for implementation work

### 2. Use The Feature Factory

For non-trivial feature work, ask Claude Code to use the feature factory:

```text
Use the feature-factory skill to build the enabled-session children's check-in flow.
Start with research only and pause after the story and technical brief.
```

Expected flow:

1. `codebase-researcher` maps files, patterns, risks, and tests.
2. `story-writer` writes the user story and acceptance criteria.
3. Human approves or revises the story.
4. `spec-writer` writes the technical brief.
5. Human approves or revises the brief.
6. `backend-builder` implements server/data/provider work.
7. `frontend-builder` implements routes/components/mobile web UI.
8. `test-verifier` adds or reviews tests against the story.
9. `implementation-validator` reviews the result.
10. `pr-reviewer` reviews the final diff or PR when requested.

### 3. Wire The Safety Hook

`.claude/settings.example.json` shows a hook configuration that runs `.claude/hooks/pre-commit.sh` before Claude Code attempts `git commit`.

Keep local permissions and settings in `.claude/settings.json`. That file remains ignored because it can contain machine-specific commands or local secrets.

### 4. Finish Work

Before handoff, Claude Code should report:

- files changed
- behavior added or changed
- docs updated
- verification commands and results
- known residual risks or pre-existing failures

Run when feasible:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Use `npm test` for implementation work where the test suite is expected to pass or when changing tested behavior.

## Codex How-To

Codex does not consume `.claude/agents/*.md` as native Claude subagents. The Codex-compatible setup uses repo-local skills instead.

### Preferred Codex Workflow

Use Codex when working directly in this repository with repo-local skills and normal shell verification.

```text
Use the churchcore-feature-factory skill for <feature>.
Follow the role contracts, pause before implementation if the story or brief is unclear, update docs, verify, then commit and push.
```

Preferred sequence:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, relevant docs, and relevant ADRs.
2. Use `churchcore-feature-factory` for non-trivial feature work.
3. Use `churchcore-build-with-tests` for implementation once the brief is clear.
4. Keep write phases sequential; use parallel reads only for independent research.
5. Update `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and affected docs.
6. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and focused tests where applicable.
7. Use `churchcore-pr-review` against the final diff.
8. Commit on a feature branch, push the branch, open a pull request, merge through GitHub after required checks/review, then pull `main`.

## GitHub Delivery Rule

The default branch is protected and admin enforcement is enabled. Factory runs must use this delivery path:

```text
feature branch -> push branch -> open PR -> required checks/review -> GitHub merge -> pull main
```

Direct pushes to `main` are not part of normal development. Reserve bypasses only for emergency repository administration, and document the reason in `docs/factory-runs/` if one ever occurs.

### 1. Start With Repository Rules

Codex should read:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
3. relevant ADRs and docs
4. one of the `.codex/skills/` workflows

### 2. Use Codex Skills

For feature work:

```text
Use the churchcore-feature-factory skill to plan and implement the mobile web member check-in flow.
Pause before implementation if the story or technical brief has unresolved product rules.
```

For implementation work:

```text
Use the churchcore-build-with-tests skill to implement the approved brief.
```

For review:

```text
Use the churchcore-pr-review skill to review this diff before merge.
```

### 3. Codex Role Mapping

Codex maps the Claude agents into phases described in `.codex/skills/churchcore-feature-factory/references/agent-roles.md`:

- Codebase Researcher -> exploration phase
- Story Writer -> acceptance criteria phase
- Spec Writer -> technical brief phase
- Backend Builder -> server/data/provider implementation phase
- Frontend Builder -> route/component/mobile UI implementation phase
- Test Verifier -> acceptance and edge-case test phase
- Implementation Validator -> final implementation review phase
- PR Reviewer -> PR/diff review phase

Codex can run read-only exploration in parallel, but write phases must be sequential.

### 4. Finish Work

Codex should end with:

- files changed
- behavior added or changed
- verification commands and results
- residual risks or pre-existing failures

Run when feasible:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Gemini How-To

Use Gemini (Antigravity) when working with native Planning Mode, where implementation plans (`implementation_plan.md`), task lists (`task.md`), and validation records (`walkthrough.md`) are integrated into the workflow.

### Preferred Gemini Workflow

```text
Use the gemini-feature-factory skill for <feature>.
Start with research, use Planning Mode to formulate the plan, request feedback, obtain approval, implement sequentially tracking progress in task.md, verify with tests/lint/build, and record findings in walkthrough.md.
```

Expected sequence:
1. **Explore:** Read `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, and relevant ADRs. Explore code using `grep_search` and `list_dir`.
2. **Plan:** Write/update the `implementation_plan.md` artifact. Set `request_feedback = true` and wait for the user to explicitly approve before writing any code.
3. **Execute:** Implement the feature in vertical slices. Track TODOs in `task.md` (`[ ]`, `[/]`, `[x]`).
4. **Verify & document:** Run tests, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`. Document implementation details, testing results, and remaining risks in `walkthrough.md`.

## Operating Rules

- Research before implementation.
- Human approval is required after story and technical brief for non-trivial features.
- Read-only phases can run in parallel.
- Write phases run sequentially.
- Keep features as coherent vertical slices.
- Update docs and changelog for meaningful changes.
- Do not claim success without verification evidence.
- Keep Claude, Codex, and Gemini workflow files aligned when changing factory behavior.
